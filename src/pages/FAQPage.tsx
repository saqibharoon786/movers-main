            <p>
              Most delays are documentation issues, not freight capacity. Keep passports, visas, inventory lists, and
              valuation sheets consistent across every form. If you are unsure about HS codes or restricted items, ask
              early — corrections at the port cost more than corrections at the kitchen table.
