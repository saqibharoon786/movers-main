    a: "A 2-bedroom apartment move from Islamabad or Rawalpindi to Dubai typically costs between PKR 350,000 and PKR 500,000 door-to-door, depending on volume, packing requirements, and current freight rates. Contact us for an accurate itemised quote after a free survey.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the cheapest way to move internationally from Pakistan?",
    a: "LCL sea freight is the most economical method for smaller volumes under 12 CBM. For larger volumes, FCL sea freight becomes more cost-effective per CBM than LCL. Air freight is significantly more expensive and suitable only for urgent, smaller consignments.",

  {
    q: "Do I pay customs duty when moving abroad from Pakistan?",
    a: "Pakistan export customs clearance costs are part of the origin charges.

We clarify destination duty obligations in every quotation.",

      <p>
        How much does it actually cost to move internationally from Pakistan in 2026? This is the first question every
        family asks — and it is the one question most moving companies in Pakistan deliberately avoid answering clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
        This guide gives you the complete, honest answer. Every cost component explained. Every variable that affects
        your final bill identified. Real price ranges for the most common routes — Pakistan to UAE, UK, USA, Canada,
        Australia, and Saudi Arabia. And the hidden costs that catch most people by surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are Best International Movers &amp; Logistics — with 15+ years and 15,000+ international shipments from
        Pakistan. We have seen every cost mistake there is. This guide is written so you do not make them.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Moving Costs from Pakistan Vary So Much</h2>
      <p>
        Before getting into numbers, understand this: international moving cost from Pakistan is not a single figure. It
        is the sum of multiple components, each of which varies based on your specific situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two families moving from Islamabad to Dubai in the same month can have total costs that differ by hundreds of
        thousands of rupees — because one has a 2-bedroom apartment and the other has a 4-bedroom villa, one chooses LCL
        and the other FCL, one packs themselves and the other uses professional export packing, and their destination
        areas have different local delivery charges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone who quotes you a flat rate without a survey is either guessing or hiding the real numbers. Understand the
        components first — then the quote makes sense.
      </p>

      <h2>The 7 Cost Components of International Moving from Pakistan</h2>

      <h3>Component 1: Pre-Move Survey (Free)</h3>
      <p>
        A professional pre-move survey is always free. Any company charging for a survey is not worth hiring. The survey
        determines your cubic volume (CBM), which drives almost every other cost in the chain.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cost:</strong> PKR 0
      </p>

      <h3>Component 2: Professional Export Packing</h3>
      <p>
        Export packing for international moves is fundamentally different from local house shifting packing. Your goods
        will spend weeks in a steel container subjected to humidity, vibration, and handling at multiple ports. Packing
        that is adequate for local shifting will not survive an international sea journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professional export packing includes double-walled export cartons, furniture blankets, stretch wrap, foam
        padding, bubble wrap for fragile items, and wooden crating for antiques, marble, and high-value pieces.
      </p>
      <p>Typical packing cost ranges:</p>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>Ranges vary based on fragility levels, number of specialty items, and access conditions.</p>

      <h3>Component 3: Inland Haulage — Your City to Karachi Port</h3>
      <p>
        Goods originating in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore, or Peshawar must travel overland to Karachi port before ocean
        loading. This inland leg is a significant cost that many people forget to factor in when comparing quotes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The road distance from Islamabad to Karachi is approximately 1,400 km. Goods move in closed cargo trucks — the
        type and size depending on your volume and container configuration.
      </p>
      <p>Typical inland haulage ranges:</p>
      <div className="not-prose my-6 overflow-x-auto rounded-xl border border-border">
        <table className="min-w-[720px] w-full text-sm">

      </div>
      <p>Costs vary by truck size, weight, and current fuel prices.</p>

      <h3>Component 4: Ocean Freight — The Biggest Variable</h3>
      <p>
        Ocean freight is typically the largest single cost in an international move from Pakistan. It is also the most
        volatile — rates change with global shipping market conditions, fuel prices, and seasonal demand.

      <p>These are ocean freight only — they exclude origin handling, documentation, and destination charges.</p>

      <h3>Component 5: Pakistan Export Customs and Documentation</h3>
      <p>
        Every international shipment from Pakistan requires export customs clearance through the WeBOC system. Costs
        include customs agent fees, documentation preparation, and port processing charges.
      </p>
      <p>Typical customs and documentation cost:</p>

      </div>

      <h3>Component 6: Destination Charges</h3>
      <p>
        Destination charges are where many international moving quotes fall apart. A company quotes you a low origin
        freight number — and then destination charges arrive as a surprise invoice after your goods have already sailed.
      </p>
      <p>Destination charges typically include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Destination Terminal Handling Charge (DTHC): Port fees at the receiving terminal</li>
        <li>Destination Customs Clearance: Import declaration filing and customs agent fees</li>
        <li>
          Import Duties and Taxes: Varies enormously by country and commodity — personal effects are often duty-free in
          UAE and UK but rules vary
        </li>
        <li>Local Delivery: Transport from destination port to your new address</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Approximate destination charge ranges by country:</p>

      <p>Personal effects import rules and duty exemptions vary by country — always clarify in writing.</p>

      <h3>Component 7: Marine Insurance</h3>
      <p>
        Marine insurance is not included in freight quotes. It is a separate product and a separate decision. Without
        it, your recourse in the event of loss or damage at sea is limited to the carrier&apos;s standard liability —
        typically USD 2 per kilogram, which is a fraction of the actual value of most household goods.
      </p>
      <p>
        All-risk marine insurance is typically calculated as:
        <br />
        0.5% to 1.5% of the declared cargo value
      </p>
      <p>
        For a household valued at PKR 5,000,000 — insurance at 1% = PKR 50,000. That is the cost of insuring everything.
        Not buying it to save PKR 50,000 when your cargo is worth PKR 5,000,000 is a risk that rarely makes financial
        sense.

      <h2>What Makes Moving Costs Higher Than Expected</h2>

      <h3>Adding Furniture After the Survey</h3>
      <p>
        The pre-move survey determines your CBM and drives your container size recommendation. Buying new furniture or
        adding items after the survey can push you from LCL into FCL, or from a 20ft to a 40ft container — with
        significant cost implications. Finalise your inventory before the survey.
      </p>

      <h3>Self-Packing That Fails Customs Inspection</h3>
      <p>
        Self-packed items that do not meet export standards can be rejected for loading or opened and repacked at your
        cost at the port. Professional packing costs less than emergency repacking under time pressure at Karachi.
      </p>

      <h3>Destination Demurrage and Storage</h3>
      <p>
        If your destination customs clearance is delayed — because of incorrect documentation, missing import permits, or
        simply slow processing — your container sits at the destination port. Most carriers allow 5–7 free days. After
        that, demurrage charges accumulate daily. On a 40ft container at a busy European or Australian port, demurrage
        can reach USD 150–300 per day.
      </p>

      <h3>Currency Fluctuation</h3>
      <p>
        Most ocean freight is quoted in USD. Between booking and final invoice, exchange rate movement can affect your
        total PKR cost. Ask for a fixed-rate quote with a validity period, and understand which components are fixed
        versus variable.
      </p>

      <h3>Choosing the Cheapest Quote Without Reading the Scope</h3>
      <p>
        The cheapest international moving quote is almost never the cheapest move. Low quotes typically exclude
        destination charges, marine insurance, and sometimes even inland haulage — costs that appear later as
        supplementary invoices. Always compare total door-to-door costs, not origin freight only.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Get an Accurate Moving Cost from Pakistan</h2>
      <p>
        The only way to get a reliable moving cost from Pakistan is a physical pre-move survey followed by an itemised
        written quotation. Here is what a proper quotation should include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Packing materials and crew cost</li>
        <li>Inland haulage from your city to Karachi</li>
        <li>Origin terminal handling charge</li>
        <li>Ocean freight (FCL per container or LCL per CBM)</li>
        <li>Pakistan export customs and documentation</li>
        <li>Destination terminal handling charge</li>
        <li>Destination customs clearance fee</li>
        <li>Local delivery at destination</li>
        <li>Marine insurance (quoted separately)</li>
        <li>Quote validity period</li>
        <li>What is fixed and what is subject to variation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If any of these components are missing from a quotation you receive, ask specifically why.</p>
