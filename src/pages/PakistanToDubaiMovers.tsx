  },
  {
    q: "What is the cheapest way to move from Pakistan to Dubai?",
    a: "LCL sea freight (shared container) is the most affordable option for moves under 10 CBM. For larger moves (full household), a 20-foot FCL container often works out cheaper per CBM than LCL. Call 0300-9130211 and our team will calculate the most cost-effective option for your specific volume and timeline.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a UAE visa to ship my household goods to Dubai?",
    a: "Yes. UAE Customs requires proof of residency (UAE visa, Emirates ID, or a confirmed employment/residency visa) to clear household goods duty-free. We guide you through the exact documents needed. If your visa is still processing, we can arrange temporary storage in Dubai until you are ready to clear.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I ship my car from Pakistan to Dubai?",
    a: "Yes. We ship cars via RoRo (Roll-on Roll-off) vessels from Karachi Port to Jebel Ali Port. Transit is 7–10 days. Requirements: car must be clean, fuel tank under 1/4 full, registration documents in order. UAE import duty applies on vehicles (varies by engine size and value).",
  },
  {
    q: "What items are banned from shipping to Dubai?",
    a: "Prohibited items include alcohol, pork products, all narcotics, certain prescription medications (check UAE controlled substances list), counterfeit goods, gambling equipment, and material considered offensive under UAE law. Our pre-shipment consultation covers every item in your home.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you do home packing in Rawalpindi and Islamabad?",
    a: "Yes — our packing teams are based in Rawalpindi and cover all Islamabad sectors, Bahria Town, DHA, and surrounding areas. We use export-grade packing materials. Packing is typically done 1–2 days before the truck departs for Karachi Port.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if my goods get stuck at Dubai Customs?",
    a: "Our Dubai partner agents monitor every shipment daily at Jebel Ali. If customs requires additional documents, we respond within hours. Storage (demurrage) at Jebel Ali costs money — our pre-clearance document preparation is specifically designed to prevent any delays. We have a 98% first-attempt clearance rate.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get a quote for moving from Pakistan to Dubai?",
    a: "Three ways: (1) Call or WhatsApp 0300-9130211 directly, (2) fill the contact form on this page, or (3) email info@bestintlmovers.com.

            The cost of moving from Pakistan to Dubai depends on three factors: the volume of your goods (measured in cubic meters or CBM), your chosen freight method (sea or air), and any additional services like packing, storage, or vehicle shipping.
